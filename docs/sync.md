# How `orivo sync` works

`orivo sync` keeps the local SQLite database (todos + pomodoro sessions) in sync with a
private GitHub repo, WhatsApp-style: a single gzip-compressed snapshot, overwritten in place
each time. It shells out to the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) and `git` rather
than talking to any API directly.

This doc describes the current implementation. Source: `src/domains/sync.rs` (orchestration),
`src/utils/gh.rs` (`gh`/`git` process wrappers), `src/config/sync.rs` (config), `src/cmds/sync.rs`
(CLI entry point).

## Prerequisites

- **`gh`, signed in.** `orivo sync` never handles GitHub authentication itself — it checks
  `gh auth status` and, if that fails, tells you to run `gh auth login` and exits. There's no
  OAuth client, no secrets, no keyring entry anywhere in orivo's own code for this.
- **`git`**, for the local clone/commit/push mechanics.

## What gets synced

Only the database file (`db_path()` — `orivo.sqlite`). Nothing else: `config.toml` and
`store.json` are per-machine preferences, not synced.

## Configuration

```toml
[sync]
repo_name = "orivo-data" # name of the GitHub repo (under your account) synced with
```

`repo_name` (`src/config/sync.rs`) defaults to `"orivo-data"` in release builds and
`"orivo-data-dev"` in debug builds, so a local `cargo run sync` during development can never
touch the same repo a real install would use. It's always created/looked up under the
signed-in `gh` user's own account — there's no way to point it at someone else's repo.

## Where things live on disk

| What | Path (release) | Path (debug) |
|---|---|---|
| Database | `~/.local/state/orivo/orivo.sqlite` | `./.dev/orivo.sqlite` |
| Sync state (`sync.json`) | `~/.local/state/orivo/sync.json` | `./.dev/sync.json` |
| Local git clone | `~/.local/state/orivo/sync/` | `./.dev/sync/` |

The local git clone is reused across runs (`git fetch` instead of a fresh `gh repo clone`
every time), so a sync after the first one only downloads new commits, not the whole
repo/database again.

## The GitHub repo itself

- Named `owner/<repo_name>` — created via `gh repo create <name> --private` the first time
  `orivo sync` runs and the repo doesn't already exist (checked with `gh repo view`).
- Always **private**.
- Holds exactly one file: `orivo.sqlite.gz` (the database, gzip-compressed).
- **No real commit history.** Every sync amends the previous commit and force-pushes over it
  (`git commit --amend` + `git push --force`), rather than adding a new commit each time. The
  repo is a single overwritten snapshot, not a version history — this mirrors WhatsApp/Drive
  -style backups and keeps the repo from growing forever from repeated full-database uploads.
  (See [Why a plain `--force` push](#why-a-plain---force-push) for why it's not
  `--force-with-lease`.)

## The sync algorithm

Everything happens in `run_sync()` (`src/domains/sync.rs`):

1. **Check `gh` sign-in.** `gh::is_authenticated()` runs `gh auth status`. If it fails, sync
   stops immediately with an error telling you to run `gh auth login`.
2. **Ensure the repo exists.** `gh::ensure_repo(repo_name)` resolves the signed-in username
   (`gh api user -q .login`), checks whether `owner/<repo_name>` exists (`gh repo view`), and
   creates it private if not.
3. **Ensure the local clone is current.** `gh::ensure_clone()`: if `<sync_dir>/.git` already
   exists, `git fetch origin`; otherwise `gh repo clone owner/<repo_name> <sync_dir>` (this
   works fine even against a brand-new, completely empty repo — it just produces a clone with
   no commits yet).
4. **Compare.** This is the core of the "pull if needed, push if needed" behavior — see
   [Change detection](#change-detection) below.
5. **Act**: push, pull, prompt for a conflict, or do nothing, depending on step 4's result.

## Change detection

Nothing is diffed file-by-file. Three SHA-256 hashes of the whole gzipped database blob decide
everything:

1. **`local_hash`** — read the live `orivo.sqlite`, gzip it in memory, hash the gzipped bytes.
2. **`remote_hash`** — `git show origin/<branch>:orivo.sqlite.gz` inside the local clone (reads
   the committed blob straight out of git's object store — no checkout needed), hash the
   result. `None` if the repo has never had anything pushed to it.
3. **`last_synced_hash`** — loaded from `sync.json`: the hash recorded after the *last
   successful* sync. This is orivo's own memory of "what I already synced," independent of
   git.

```rust
let local_changed  = last_synced_hash != Some(local_hash);
let remote_changed = remote_hash      != last_synced_hash;
```

Local and remote are never compared to each other directly — both are compared against the
last-known-synced hash. That's what lets orivo tell *which side* changed instead of just *that*
they differ.

| Repo state | `local_changed` | `remote_changed` | Action |
|---|:-:|:-:|---|
| Repo has nothing pushed yet | — | — | **push**, unconditionally (see below) |
| Neither side changed | no | no | nothing — "already up to date" |
| Only the local database changed | yes | no | **push** |
| Only the GitHub repo changed (e.g. synced from another machine) | no | yes | **pull** |
| Both changed | yes | yes | **prompt**: keep local or keep remote |

### The empty-repo special case

If `remote_gz` comes back `None` (nothing has ever been pushed), `run_sync` pushes
immediately and skips the hash-comparison table above entirely. This matters because a stale
`sync.json` — e.g. left over from a sync that failed after recording a hash for a repo that
then got deleted or recreated — would otherwise make an empty repo look like a "both changed"
conflict for no real reason. An empty repo has no data to protect, so there's nothing to ask
about.

## Push

`push()` in `src/domains/sync.rs` calls `gh::commit_and_push()`:

1. Write the gzipped bytes to `<sync_dir>/orivo.sqlite.gz`.
2. `git add orivo.sqlite.gz`.
3. If the clone already has a commit (`git rev-parse --verify -q HEAD` succeeds),
   `git commit --amend`; otherwise (first-ever push) a normal `git commit`.
4. `git push --force -u origin HEAD:<branch>`.
5. On success, record `local_hash` as the new `last_synced_hash` in `sync.json`.

### Why a plain `--force` push

The first implementation used `--force-with-lease`, which failed in practice with
`! [rejected] HEAD -> main (stale info)` — `--force-with-lease` verifies the push against the
local `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` tracking ref, and that ref simply doesn't exist yet before
a branch has ever been fetched (e.g. the very first push to a freshly created repo), so the
lease check fails even though the push is completely safe. Since the actual "is this safe to
overwrite" decision already happened one layer up — the content-hash comparison against
`sync.json` — the git-level lease is redundant safety that was actively breaking normal
operation. A plain `--force` is used instead.

## Pull

`pull()` in `src/domains/sync.rs`:

1. Gunzip the remote blob (read during the comparison step, via `git show`).
2. Write it to a temp file next to the database and `fs::rename` it over `db_path()`
   (atomic — never leaves a partially-written database on failure).
3. Record `remote_hash` as the new `last_synced_hash` in `sync.json`.

## Conflict resolution

When both sides changed since the last sync, `resolve_conflict()` prints:

```
both the local database and the github repo have changed since the last sync.
keep [l]ocal (push, overwriting the repo) or [r]emote (pull, overwriting local)?
```

and reads a line from stdin: `l`/`local` pushes, `r`/`remote` pulls, anything else (including
just pressing enter) cancels the sync with no changes made on either side. There's no
automatic merge — the database is a single opaque binary blob, so "merging" isn't meaningful;
one side has to be chosen to fully overwrite the other.

## Terminal output

Every step prints as it happens (rather than staying silent until the end), so a slow network
call doesn't look like a hang:

```
checking github CLI sign-in...
checking for github repo orivo-data...
found existing repo <owner>/orivo-data
fetching latest changes from <owner>/orivo-data...
comparing local database with github...
local database changed, github did not — pushing
pushing to github...
pushed local changes to github
```

All messages are lowercase, including "github" itself, matching the rest of the CLI's output
style.

## Error cases

- **`gh` not signed in** → "not signed in to the github CLI; run `gh auth login` first", exits
  before touching the repo or the network.
- **`gh` or `git` not installed** → the process spawn fails and surfaces a message naming
  which binary is missing and, for `gh`, a link to install it.
- **Any `gh`/`git` command exits non-zero** (repo creation fails, clone fails, push fails,
  etc.) → its stderr is surfaced as the error message; `orivo sync` stops rather than trying to
  recover automatically.
